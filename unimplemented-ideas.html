        Web Pages Served within WiFi range of a location not on the internet, encrypted or open WiFi
      </a>You can do this with an off the shelf WiFi router and stock firmware with some models I think. I am familiar
        with the DD-WRT firmware as of about 2010, but this is not what we were using it for and you have to reflash the
        equipment to use DD-WRT, but that's a pretty simple process. I'll have to look up how to upload web pages.
        I think the above is just configuring the server. It already has a web server out of the box, that's why you can log into it 
        with a laptop. This can be connected to the internet or on a separate wifi box but I don't know how you'd do it with the one you get from
        your ISP by default. The DD-WRT forum has been updated as late as today, even though the homepage has no 'recent news' since September 2022.
      <em><u><b>If you somehow wind up trapped in a house, location, or abusive relationship without internet (and/or out of range of
        emergency rescue services), and you have this knowledge and a USB stick and can sneak or trick your way to using a computer with wireless you
      can use this knowledge to call for help to foot traffic or repeater stations in the neighborhood. Set the network name to helpme or some codeword?
      you can teach this to fairly young children, friends, intellectually disabled. some literacy and knowing how to use a keyboard and mouse is pretty much required though </b></u></em>

      Front yard bulletin board materials, plan, assembly, construction installation. One side with screwed down plexi cover for my use only.
      One side 1/2 white board, 1/2 magnet or bulletin board depending on climate, weather shielding, and expense requirement.
      Business card holder, zine holder, markers and erasers, notice that public side can be closed in case of abuse, overuse, hostile
      propaganda/ideologies, or vandalism. Erasures and take down are at my discretion and anyone elses. And also just for maintenance
      and turnover. If someone took your flier it may be that they wanted to take it with them or to someone, not censor it. No stickers or permanent markers or paint.
