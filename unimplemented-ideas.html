      28th Amendment to the US Constitution? --> 'the free practice of medicine being necessary to the security of a free

      Record a voice memo with your phone and wherever right wing talk radio plays or any other FM station, you can broadcast in
      traffic all the time on loop with the 12v transmitter idea below while your own stereo plays something else.

        Web Pages Served within WiFi range of a location not on the internet, encrypted or open WiFi
      </a>You can do this with an off the shelf WiFi router and stock firmware with some models I think. I am familiar
        with the DD-WRT firmware as of about 2010, but this is not what we were using it for and you have to reflash the
        equipment to use DD-WRT, but that's a pretty simple process. I'll have to look up how to upload web pages.
        I think the above is just configuring the server. It already has a web server out of the box, that's why you can log into it 
        with a laptop. This can be connected to the internet or on a separate wifi box but I don't know how you'd do it with the one you get from
        your ISP by default. The DD-WRT forum has been updated as late as today, even though the homepage has no 'recent news' since September 2022.
      <em><u><b>If you somehow wind up trapped in a house, location, or abusive relationship without internet (and/or out of range of
        emergency rescue services), and you have this knowledge and a USB stick and can sneak or trick your way to using a computer with wireless you
      can use this knowledge to call for help to foot traffic or repeater stations in the neighborhood. Set the network name to helpme or some codeword?
      you can teach this to fairly young children, friends, intellectually disabled. some literacy and knowing how to use a keyboard and mouse is pretty much required though </b></u></em>

      Short range radio broadcasts - car with 12v plug (formerly cigarette lighter) or wall plugin with 12v plug, FM transmitter from truckstop or Amazon like we used to
      use to connect a discman or ipod to a car radio when it didnt have cd player or audio in. And bluetooth headset for your phone. Connect FM transmitter to headphone jack. Not 
      sure how to enable headphone jack and bluetooth headset at the same time....

      Front yard bulletin board materials, plan, assembly, construction installation. One side with screwed down plexi cover for my use only.
      One side 1/2 white board, 1/2 magnet or bulletin board depending on climate, weather shielding, and expense requirement.

      propaganda/ideologies, or vandalism. Erasures and take down are at my discretion and anyone elses. And also just for maintenance
      and turnover. If someone took your flier it may be that they wanted to take it with them or to someone, not censor it. No stickers or permanent markers or paint.
