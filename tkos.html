            <p>This page and site will continue to evolve and be refined. Since I am now sending out postcards with this URL and glyph based 'fortunes' I need to get something
        online. This is kind of the minimum quality I was willing to expose to the public. There's a bit more to this
        brainstorming / fortune telling / creativity tool / divination architecture but this is all you need to
        form your own conclusions or ideas if you want to draw meaning from it. I first began working on a version of this in 2016
        and I think it has just about reached its final version, although I intend to eventually refine the designs into 
        a card deck, posters and other more graphically polished items to try to sell, probably through a print on demand service.
        I have my doubts about whether getting significant inventory manufactured and trying to place it in stores or sell online would produce results worth the investment.
            </p>
            <p>I usually work with these in chains of 3 symbols, and u7nlike tarot, the positions do not have predetermined
        significance and there is no such thing as 'reversed cards'. But you can use spreads or other bells and whistles however you want. When the logic symbols
        or the parentheses come up I tend to draw more or arrange them in such a way as to make a legible math/logic-like 'sentence'. 
            </p>   
            <p>
        There are two ways I usually use to draw the symbols. For expediency there is random.org which gathers its entropy from some sort of 
        'atmospheric noise' to get 'true random numbers' instead of the pseudo-random number generator computers use for most tasks. They've been running since 
        the 90s and you can use them as a certified third party for lotteries or drawings for a fee.
        The other way is to set the symbols up as an 8x6 grid and select the row by rolling a six sided dice and selecting the column by 
        flipping a coin three times to generate a binary number from 0-7 from the heads and tails of the coin. But be sure of whether youre writing numbers
        from right to left or left to right before you start to avoid confusion.
            </p>
            <p>Either method provides a much stronger randomization than card shuffling, I do believe, and with less work. 
        Use your head and don't let oracles of any type run your life or get compulsive with them. There may or may not be something to it on some occasions.
        But brainstorming and fortune telling, depending on how you approach them, can be nearly the same practice. And sometimes you may want to
        make a decision where there is no definite right answer (like in writing a novel). Or with questions wherein you have no possible way to access information about
        what will produce the 'best' outcomes you want (such as most of the significant things looming up in your not-predestined future, for example) and with them you want a little extra help or outside
        ideas to shake your mind into a new shape? In such a case this system could be helpful, whether you believe it has any real predictive power or not. And you can do the same thing with any collection of 48 elements of any type (or another quantity that can be arrayed
        in a grid, but the ubiquity of six sided dice and coins makes 48 a handy number of elements or keys to use in your preferred systems).

            <a href="https://voteforward.org"><img class="pure-img body-img" src="img/voteforward.png" alt=""></a>

            <p>If you are writing letters with Vote Forward and you would would like to add 'fortune cookies' from my creation <a href="https://tkos.dev">The Key of Sparrows</a> to them, I have created a web page (this one in fact!) with <a href="https://tkos.dev/nonpartisan.html">a key to the beginnings of meanings for TKOS symbols stripped of partisan or one-click-away-from-partisan links</a> so that I can do that (and now so can you if you want!) and still follow Vote Forward's rules. I dropped my first 6 letters for Vote Forward in the mail today after my 4 types of stamps for letters arrived from USPS. I am including a numbered & signed but no text block blank postcard with them with a 'fortune cookie'  symbol string, and also a Vote Forward <a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/files/ww74w4oh/production/479deb14d14ffe7faa2dd3c33bae4e38d3665cde.pdf">voter checklist printable</a> and <a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/files/ww74w4oh/production/231089504b2dd0bafa6d5a966917177815eb186f.pdf">voter buddy printable</a> in the envelope. You don't have to include as many of the extras or personal touches or you can invent your own. You can reach more people with your <a href="https://soundcloud.com/cooperdozier/only-2-hands-a-meditation?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing"><em>Only Two Hands</em></a> if your extras and personal touches are briefer. They also have a <a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/files/ww74w4oh/production/ac2c413542ef750ec5e48d228d5b877093137f12.pdf">Basics of the offices (not candidates) on a ballot</a> printable for people new to politics which I am not including but you can.</p>

            <p>Vote Forward says <b><i><u>October Twenty Nine</u></i></b> is the last day to send letters to voters. Alaska and Hawaii may perhaps be different? I have not checked to see if they allow people presently with street addresses in Mexico Canada or Other Countries to participate in their address lists. But you could send whatever stuff you like to any rectangle you can click on Google maps if you want to send a lot of untargeted things which may or may not actually have registered voters living there or checking the mail <b><i><u>! ðŸ’¥ ! ðŸ’¥ ! ðŸ’¥ ! ðŸ’¥ !</u></i></b></p>
            
            <p>A <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=paper+cutter">paper cutter</a> and a <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=epson+ecotank">$200 Epson EcoTank</a> printer makes this process/activity faster and cheaper. Friends you can hang out with and not being down to your last dollar make it safer and more fun. You can get such things at your nearby Office Depot or for the Paper Cutter, some types at Craft stores like Joann or Michaels. Don't know about Hobby Lobby. The EcoTank can be fancy or cheap, but it's a range of printers not a single one. You can also decorate your walls with photos & other stuff from Unsplash.com or somewhere once you can print up as much color as you want without breaking the bank. Use loops of the blue painters tape on the back.</p>
            <p>Not going to link all 4 here because I'm busy til after election tuesday (seriously can we not even move it to the weekend? this is bullshit. But you can vote early and/or by mail in most states now!), the ones I sent off today are the the Title IX Forever stamps. Remember to shred or burn the address lists from Vote Forward when you are finished with them, as that is sensitive information. Yes, that is in their instructions except they only mention shredding. I don't have a shredder, so a burnt offering on the porch or firepit would seem like the ticket. This may be a new printing I feel like mine looked a bit different not at home can't check right now: <a href="https://store.usps.com/store/product/title-ix-stamps-S_481704">Title IX Forever Stamps</a></p>

            <p>Below is the "Victory 2024!" postcard I'm sending out. The front stays the same, the back is always evolving.
                My <a href="https://poeticpostcards.wordpress.com/about">postcard project</a> is now into its 9th year, 4th postcard design, and [as of several days ago, 10/15] somewhere north of 3,800 postcards sent or given out with something more than 900 and less than 1,000 of design #4 left to go.

        <blockquote>
	    <p>
		The authors argue that while it seems like the climate change catastrophe is rolling on unchecked, governmental and international action are insufficient, and corporate power continues to hold back progress, the incredible advances that have been made since 2010 have already taken the direst scenarios of 4-8 degrees centigrade of warming off the table. They argue that if this is what could be accomplished in 10ish years with market, individual, NGO, and community forces and technological advances, now that governments (and some businesses) are gettng more serious (and technology continues to drop prices and raise efficiencies), far more progress is in the near future. Hence "We WILL fix climate change!". Not to say that there won't continue to be damages, but we are well on the way to taming their expansion and repairing some of them. There is an extended discussion of doomism and despair and how that really only helps the biggest emitters and fossil companies who benefit if people are too disengaged or depressed to do anything about it (they may even promote it...).
