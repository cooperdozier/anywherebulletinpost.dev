An Open Source Business Plan for Journalist / Creative Type Human Independent Operators

For Novices: If you have never used GitHub before, the way to get the code/files and make a website clone and go is: click the green Code button, click Download Zip, extract it on your computer, and double click either HTML file, they will open from your hard disk into a web browser. Any text editor or programmer's text editor can be used for modifications and writing web page content. Microsoft's Visual Studio Code*** is free and very popular. Learning to use git CLI processes is not necessary. Installing git is not necessary. When and if you want it to be public, I use Dreamhost for my webhost. Uploading is easy if you find uncomplicated instructions, but out of scope of this project.

The project is growing line by line here. May make more sense to just write within Github than to keep shooting stuff up and down from VS Code, Hard Disk, Github.....
