      <h1>About Yard BB (Yard Bulletin Board)</h1>
      <h2>Staking your claim on the information sphere for all passerby</h2>
      <p>Actually the root idea of this project, the concept of putting up your own bulletin board in
      the front yard where you make the rules.... and may or may not have a portion that other people can
      contribute to. You can distribute zines fliers and news stories and artwork from here. Expanded into the idea
      of crowdfunding journalism and other work and paired to an HTML version running off of a DD-WRT 
      after market firmware router (it already has a web server, thats why you can log into it with a web browser).
      Configuring it to serve a newspaper instead of an administration interface should be easy for them as knows how but
      I have yet to implement it. Its a digital ecosystem concept but in an effort to both do public service and make a sustainable
        living.
