    <h1>Financials</h1>
    <p>Well set up for now and coming months, waiting on a thing in California probate court to do with abandoned 
    Exxon shares from a deceased in the 1980s uncle which I get 1/18th. But I would like to start making back some 
    at least some of my expenses and maybe a stipend. Have to start filing 1099s (or get other job) if I want to keep
    participating in Social Security plan. There is apparently a minimum number of quarter-years you have to contribute
    to get anything at all..... Be the first to contribute to buymeacoffee.com/cooperdozier! Quite busy to do anything
    but those things with the most potential multipliers until I am assured that Mr. Trump will not be getting back into
    White House. I am very optimistic but that's no reason to stop working on it.</p>
